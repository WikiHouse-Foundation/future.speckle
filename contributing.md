#Contributing to `future.speckle`
##Flow: 
The `master` branch is the release branch. Whatever is there is online and running. 

The `dev` branch is where active development happens. Always fork from `/dev` for new features. 

Each new feature should go in a fork of the `dev` branch, ie. `dev/my-new-super-feature`. Once ready, submit a PR.

Ideally, we would follow [these guidelines](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) (thanks @philipbelesky).

##Style guide
There is no official style guide. Please look around and just follow the already in-place conventions. Thanks!
