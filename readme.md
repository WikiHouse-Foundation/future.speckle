#### About 

#### The Parts

There are two main parts: 
- the server app 
- the spk viewer

The SPK viewer is located in the /spkw and has, for now, its own build system. 

#### Getting started

npm install
npm run watch-simple

#### Running Locally

#### Deploying on your own server

If you want to deploy this to your own server (for various reasons), go ahead! Create a copy of the `config.local` folder, rename it `config` and pop in the details to your mongodb instance & auth0 app account. 



#### Contributing

The `master` branch is the release branch. Whatever is there is online and running. 
The `dev` branch is where active development happens. 
Each feature should go in a fork of the `dev` branch, ie. `dev\my-new-super-feature`.
